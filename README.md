#Electric Bridge

Electric Bridge is an open source organisation with the aim to lower the barrier for acquiring technical skills, building new talent and reducing the cost. (ED: work on this mission statement a bit more)

#What is an open source organisation?

Most companies from the opaque to the transparent all operate mostly the same way. You can follow what they are up to on various platforms and maybe give feedback via these same platforms but really there isn't the same level of impact you can have on things like you can with a open source project.
