#The Electric Bridge Foundation

The Electric Bridge Foundation is an open operated organisation with the aim to lower the barrier for acquiring technical skills, building new talent and reducing the cost. (ED: work on this mission statement a bit more)

#What is an open operated organisation?

Most companies from the opaque to the transparent all operate the same way. You can follow what they are up to on other platforms and give feedback via these same platforms but there isn't the same level of impact you can have like you can with a open source project.
